# AGV

## TODO:
- add smps to power drv8303 and micro (3v3)
- bulk capacitance
- usb port? depends on uC. Would need isolation probably
- isolated uart/i2c/spi port, for receiving commands from master/host
- add adc?

## Fixes:
- increase drill size on stitching vias (currently unnecessarily small)
- fix/remove thermal relief on source pads for left most FETs
- add fourth mounting hole
